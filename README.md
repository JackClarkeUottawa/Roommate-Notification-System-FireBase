## Roommate Notification System

The idea behind this app is to easily set a schedule and notify roommates when it's their turn to do a specific chore. Every day a firebase script will run that notifies roommates if it's their turn to mop, or take the garbage out.

A stretch goal is to have this app also receive confirmation through a similar mobile app. So everyone will see who did what in a decentralized way.

## Deployment

The app(WIP) is available at https://roommatechoretracker.firebaseapp.com/
